# Dotfiles
My various dotfiles with a simple script to link them up and install everything
on a new machine.

Currently running NeoVim + Tmux using iTerm2 in OSX Yosemite.


## Setup
- `$ git clone https://github.com/adambiggs/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `$ ./install.sh`
- `$ ./link.sh`
