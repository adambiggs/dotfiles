# Dotfiles
My various dotfiles with a simple script to link them up.

Currently running NeoVim + Tmux using iTerm2 in OSX Yosemite.


## Setup
When starting with a new machine, first set up Ruby, Python, NeoVim, Tmux, etc.
Then run the following commands:

- `$ git clone https://github.com/adambiggs/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
- `$ ~/.dotfiles/link.sh`
