# Dotfiles
My various dotfiles with a simple script to link them up and install everything
on a new machine.

Currently running NeoVim + Tmux using iTerm2 nightly in OSX Yosemite.


## Setup
- `$ git clone https://github.com/adambiggs/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`

## Update
- `$ source ~/.dotfiles/update`
